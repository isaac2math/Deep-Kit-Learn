# DeepLearning Tookit (based on YoLoV8, YoLoV6X, YoLoV7)
> Scikit-Learn for deep learning

Ning Xu 

* This package is directly based on and modified from several YoLo packages, including YoLoV8 by Ultralytics, YoLoV5 by Open MM lab, YoLov4 by AlexeyAB, and YoLov7 by https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7.
* This package is constructed as a university project-for-fun, only for the purpose of deep learning education, research, proof of idea/value, and other non-commerical activities.
* This package aims to construct an easy-to-access platform for deep learning (computer vision, natural language processing, etc).
* Roadmap
  * Currently the package only includes YoLoV4, V5, V6X, V7, and V8.
  * My next task is to add the F-CNN family and Mask R-CNN into the package
